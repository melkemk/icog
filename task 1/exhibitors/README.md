# Exhibitors

## Directions on Formatting

In this directory, scientific and engineered models and projects using ngc-learn
are grouped based on the scientist or research team that invented them and is
responsible for maintaining their respective grouping. In effect, sub-directories
here contain sets of exhibits that one exhibitor maintains and releases to the
public.

The contents of each exhibitor sub-directory may be organized and structured
however the exhibitor requires, though it is recommended that each sub-directory
within an exhibitor's folder pertains to a single paper/publication or
application. The only file we require in an exhibitor's folder is a single
markdown file -- `README.md` at the top-level -- containing information 
about the exhibitor and a header containing the name of the exhibitor, 
e.g., the researcher, organization, company, or research group/lab, 
as follows:
```markdown
# <NAME_OF_EXHIBITOR>

...rest of text...
```

It is up to the exhibitor to provide the relevant context and explanation of 
how a set of models relate to one another (if they do), a research group's body of 
ongoing work, or the broader goals they are meant to satisfy, hypotheses they 
are meant to test, and general research questions they seek to answer.
